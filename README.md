## Our Project:
We are creating an opportunities bulletin that will improve on the document that Mr. Blumm emails on a weekly basis. It will list internship and job opportunities that are available to students at Stuyvesant High School depending on filters that the user will choose. They will be able to filter the results based on location, grades eligible, areas of interest, when it was posted, and when they want to participate in the program. Using the calendar API, we will create a calendar that will list all application deadlines.
